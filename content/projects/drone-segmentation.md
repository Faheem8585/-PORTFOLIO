## Project Overview

Semantic segmentation system for classifying different terrain types and objects in aerial drone imagery, enabling automated environmental monitoring.

## Methodology

- **Architecture**: U-Net for pixel-wise classification
- **Dataset**: Custom drone aerial imagery dataset
- **Classes**: Multiple terrain types (vegetation, water, buildings, roads, etc.)
- **Training**: Transfer learning with pre-trained weights

## Applications

- Environmental monitoring
- Urban planning
- Agriculture precision farming
- Disaster response mapping

## Technical Stack

- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Model**: U-Net architecture
- **Processing**: OpenCV for image preprocessing
- **Evaluation**: IoU, Dice coefficient metrics
